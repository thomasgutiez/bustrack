# Bustrack
In this simple demo we make the use of API's to handle map data and reproduce animations using the integrations of Mapbox.
Calling functions triggered by buttons, to animate map pins, to show the stops of of bus route the travel from the MIT Campus to Harvardâ€™s Campus.
Very powerful.

In future examples we can potentially make use of the map api to display different types of maps using custom styling for different escenarios.
